This repository conatins the notebooks of the tests presented in the eLetter response to Hubbard and Bradley commenting on Bletery and Nocquet (Science, 2023).

You may read the description of the tests and see all the figures by simply clicking on eLetter1.ipynb, eLetter2.ipynb, eLetter3.ipynb and eLetter4.ipynb.

If you wish to run the scripts and reproduce the results, you will need to install the pyacs and pyeq libraries. 
All the instructions can be found on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JMNocquet/pyacs36.

You will also need to unzip the 2 archives containing the data (Archive_to_unzip_1.zip and Archive_to_unzip_2.zip).
Then, move all the data in the data_byEQ folder.

You should be good to go.
